# What is Cluster Analysis 
Cluster analysis is the grouping of objects based on their characteristics such that there is high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity. <br><br>

# What is Clustering 
Cluster analysis is the grouping of objects such that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than they are to objects in another cluster. The classification into clusters is done using criteria such as smallest distances, density of data points, graphs, or various statistical distributions. Cluster analysis has  wide applicability, including in unsupervised machine learning, data mining, statistics, Graph Analytics,  image processing, and numerous physical and social science applications <a href= "https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/clustering/">[1]</a>. <br><br>

# What are the uses of Clustering 
Clustering has a myriad of uses in a variety of industries. Some common applications for clustering include the following:

<li> market segmentation </li>
<li>social network analysis </li>
<li>search result grouping </li>
<li>medical imaging </li>
<li>image segmentation </li>
<li>anomaly detection </li> <br>

After clustering, each cluster is assigned a number called a cluster ID. Now, you can condense the entire feature set for an example into its cluster ID. Representing a complex example by a simple cluster ID makes clustering powerful. Extending the idea, clustering data can simplify large datasets. <a href= "https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview#what-are-the-uses-of-clustering">[2]</a>. <br><br>

# Some Clustering Methods
<br>
<li>K-Means finds clusters by minimizing the mean distance between geometric points</li>
<li>DBSCAN uses density-based spatial clustering</li>
<li>Hierarchical clustering groups data into a multilevel hierarchy tree of related graphs starting from a finest level (original) and proceeding to a coarsest level</li>
<li>Spectral clustering is a similarity graph-based algorithm that models the nearest-neighbor relationships between data points as an undirected graph</li><br>
